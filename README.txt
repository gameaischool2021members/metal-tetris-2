Overview:
The project idea for MetalTetris is based on a real challenge that sheet metal processing companies face every day. 
How do you get all the orders produced as cost-effectively as possible? 
More than half of the costs of the manufactured part can be traced back to the material costs. 
In order to produce as economically as possible, it is therefore extremely important to minimize sheet metal waste.

Instructions to Play:
Open the finalBuildv1 folder and double click the Unity Application called "Metal - Tetris".
